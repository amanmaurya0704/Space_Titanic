# Spaceship Titanic Passenger Rescue Project

Welcome to the Spaceship Titanic Passenger Rescue Project! In this interstellar data science challenge, we embark on a mission to predict and identify passengers transported to an alternate dimension following a collision with a spacetime anomaly near Alpha Centauri. Using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to rescue the lost passengers and change the course of history.

## Project Overview

Spaceship Titanic, an interstellar passenger liner, encountered a spacetime anomaly while en route to its destination. Nearly half of the 13,000 passengers were transported to an alternate dimension. Your task is to predict which passengers were affected by the anomaly, utilizing recovered data from the damaged spaceship computer system.

## Project Tasks

1. **Data Analysis:** Explore and analyze the recovered data to understand passenger profiles and anomaly effects.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features to enhance the model's predictive power.
4. **Machine Learning Models:** Implement and fine-tune various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks) for accurate predictions.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Rigorously evaluate models using cross-validation techniques, focusing on accuracy as the primary metric.
6. **Rescue Mission:** Predict and identify transported passengers, aiming for the highest rescue success rate.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python:** Utilize Python programming language for data analysis, preprocessing, and model implementation.
- **Libraries:** Leverage Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow for machine learning model implementation.
- **Notebooks:** Work with Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development and analysis.
- **Collaboration:** Engage in collaborative discussions and problem-solving with fellow data scientists on the Kaggle platform.

## Evaluation Criteria

Submissions are evaluated based on their classification accuracy, representing the percentage of correctly predicted labels. Aim for high accuracy to maximize the rescue mission's success.
